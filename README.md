# Pearson Raistrick's Main Page 

## About Me
My name is Pearson Raistrick. I am a student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics with one semester left and expected to graduate in the spring of 2025. My primary interests lie in Operations Research, most notably applications of OR tools such as linear programming, networks flows, and stochastic methods to construct real world solutions for logistical and industrial problems. I have an expansive set of courses I have taken during my time at RPI, which includes classes in operations research, probability theory, stochastic processes, advanced calculus, linear algebra, real and complex analysis, and differential equations. I plan on taking classes in graph theory and numerical methods for computing during my final semester.  

For one semester, I have had the privilege to work under the supervision of Dr. Leonid Pogorelyuk in the Mechanical, Aeronautical, and Nuclear Engineering (MANE) department, to study the possibility of developing a satellite which acts as a laser interferometer for observing exoplanets without the worry of atmospheric interference. 

Aside from mathematics, I enjoy playing and creating music. I play as a cellist in the RPI orchestra as well as in chamber groups and informal music groups throughout campus. I also play guitar and have recently taken an interest in learning jazz piano. I also have taken several classes in composing and music theory at RPI, having composed several pieces including a violin, bassoon, and piano trio performed by professional musicians. Music serves as my getaway and respite from the world and is something I like to listen to and play as frequently as possible to keep me sharp. I also enjoy going out into nature and fly fishing as much as I can and also I have a fond interest in collecting historical American currency. 

I hope this page finds you well and you are able to see and learn about something you personally may have not seen before!




## Kalman Filter Implementation
https://github.com/praistrick/Kalman-Filter-Implementation
The Kalman Filter is an effective algorithm for estimating the true state values for continuous discrete time stochastic systems. Here I demonstrate a direct implementation of the Kalman filter in a simple low dimensional system, with an architecture that can be easily built up for higher dimensional systems.

## Time Series Modeling and Methods for Forecasting and Estimating Causal Effects between Indoor and Outdoor Humidity in Residential Buildings

Currently a work in process, this is a simple yet important exploration to be made. This problem is inspired by a luthier I have recently talked to who wants to understand how long it takes for the humidity inside to be affected by the humidity outside, to properly control and correct the inside humidity and prevent his instruments from being damaged. This study can be applied to many different situations, to get a more robust understanding of humidity sensitivity control, in places such as hospitals, museums, or stores with very sensitive products that must be kept stable (antique stores, music shops, high end clothing stores, et cetera). Here I attempt to unravel the correlations between these factors by using time series techniques typically utilized in econometrics applications, to obtain a clearer picture of the influence of one on the other. 

## Monte Carlo Markov Chain Implementation for Simulated Data 

With the countless breakthroughs and increased interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications across the world, statistics and probability has become a focus as that is the engine that runs the algorithms that let us do novel analysis on old problems to obtain new findings. But as a result, many of these problems in probability are very messy or unsolvable. Most notably, the high dimensional probability distributions that are fueled by the huge datasets we have, have non elementary and unsolvable integrals, or integrals so computationally expensive that they are not worth computing. Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods combat this issue, using sophisticated monte carlo techniques to construct approximate solutions to find complicated probability distributions
